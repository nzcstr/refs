  abstract = {Pulses have a long history in sub-Saharan Africa due to their multiple benefits. Pulses, and legumes in general, can play an important role in agriculture because their ability to biologically fix atmospheric nitrogen and to enhance the biological turnover of phosphorous; thus they could become the cornerstone of sustainable agriculture in Africa. In this sense, there is a body of literature that points to diversification of existing production systems; particularly legumes species, which provides critical environmental services, including soil erosion control and soil nutrient recapitalization. This publication is a review of some of the promising strategies to support pulses cultivation and utilization on smallholder farms in sub-Saharan Africa. The review is part of the legacy of the International Year of Pulses (IYP), which sought to recognize the contribution that pulses make to human well-being and the environment.},

  abstract = {Land cover mapping over large areas is essential to address a wide spectrum of socio-environmental challenges. For this reason, many global or regional land cover products are regularly released to the scientific community. Yet, the remote sensing community has not fully addressed the challenge to extract useful information from vast volumes of satellite data. Especially, major limitations concern the use of inadequate classification schemes and “black box” methods that may not match with end-users conceptualization of geographic features. In this paper, we introduce a knowledge-driven methodological approach to automatically process Sentinel-2 time series in order to produce pre-classifications that can be adapted by end-users to match their requirements. The approach relies on a conceptual framework inspired from ontologies of scientific observation and geographic information to describe the representation of geographic entities in remote sensing images. The implementation consists in a three-stage classification system including an initial stage, a dichotomous stage and a modular stage. At each stage, the system firstly relies on natural language semantic descriptions of time series of spectral signatures before assigning labels of land cover classes. The implementation was tested on 75 time series of Sentinel-2 images (i.e. 2069 images) in the Southern Brazilian Amazon to map natural vegetation and water bodies as required by a local end-user, i.e. a non-governmental organization. The results confirmed the potential of the method to accurately detect water bodies (F-score = 0.874 for bodies larger than 10 m) and map natural vegetation (max F-score = 0.875), yet emphasizing the spatial heterogeneity of accuracy results. In addition, it proved to be efficient to provide rapid estimates of degraded riparian forests at watershed level (R2 = 0.871). Finally, we discuss potential improvements both in the system’s implementation, e.g. considering additional characteristics, and in the conceptual framework, e.g. moving from pixel- to object-based image analysis and evolving towards a hybrid system combining data- and knowledge-driven approaches.},

  abstract = {For agronomic, environmental, and economic reasons, the need for spatialized information about agricultural practices is expected to rapidly increase. In this context, we reviewed the literature on remote sensing for mapping cropping practices. The reviewed studies were grouped into three categories of practices: crop succession (crop rotation and fallowing), cropping pattern (single tree crop planting pattern, sequential cropping, and intercropping/agroforestry), and cropping techniques (irrigation, soil tillage, harvest and post-harvest practices, crop varieties, and agro-ecological infrastructures). We observed that the majority of the studies were exploratory investigations, tested on a local scale with a high dependence on ground data, and used only one type of remote sensing sensor. Furthermore, to be correctly implemented, most of the methods relied heavily on local knowledge on the management practices, the environment, and the biological material. These limitations point to future research directions, such as the use of land stratification, multi-sensor data combination, and expert knowledge-driven methods. Finally, the new spatial technologies, and particularly the Sentinel constellation, are expected to improve the monitoring of cropping practices in the challenging context of food security and better management of agro-environmental issues.},

  abstract = {Background: The perception of brightness depends on spatial context: the same stimulus can appear light or dark depending on what surrounds it. A less well-known but equally important contextual phenomenon is that the colour of a stimulus can also alter its brightness. Specifically, stimuli that are more saturated (i.e. purer in colour) appear brighter than stimuli that are less saturated at the same luminance. Similarly, stimuli that are red or blue appear brighter than equiluminant yellow and green stimuli. This non-linear relationship between stimulus intensity and brightness, called the Helmholtz-Kohlrausch (HK) effect, was first described in the nineteenth century but has never been explained. Here, we take advantage of the relative simplicity of this ‘illusion’ to explain it and contextual effects more generally, by using a simple Bayesian ideal observer model of the human visual ecology. We also use fMRI brain scans to identify the neural correlates of brightness without changing the spatial context of the stimulus, which has complicated the interpretation of related fMRI studies. Results: Rather than modelling human vision directly, we use a Bayesian ideal observer to model human visual ecology. We show that the HK effect is a result of encoding the non-linear statistical relationship between retinal images and natural scenes that would have been experienced by the human visual system in the past. We further show that the complexity of this relationship is due to the response functions of the cone photoreceptors, which themselves are thought to represent an efficient solution to encoding the statistics of images. Finally, we show that the locus of the response to the relationship between images and scenes lies in the primary visual cortex (V1), if not earlier in the visual system, since the brightness of colours (as opposed to their luminance) accords with activity in V1 as measured with fMRI. Conclusions: The data suggest that perceptions of brightness represent a robust visual response to the likely sources of stimuli, as determined, in this instance, by the known statistical relationship between scenes and their retinal responses. While the responses of the early visual system (receptors in this case) may represent specifically the statistics of images, post receptor responses are more likely represent the statistical relationship between images and scenes. A corollary of this suggestion is that the visual cortex is adapted to relate the retinal image to behaviour given the statistics of its past interactions with the sources of retinal images: the visual cortex is adapted to the signals it receives from the eyes, and not directly to the world beyond.},

{$>$}\emph{"Farming systems in West Africa have evolved over the last decades along a certain development pathway (e.g., Stoop et al., 1999). We will describe this development, in particular in relation to changes in indicators of management performance related to soil fertility maintenance at the farm level. At the time that the herdsman was pleading for a cure against land hunger, arable farming systems were at the point of change from fallow systems to permanent cropping. Earlier, these farming systems practised long fallow periods to sustain soil fertility and co-existed with pastoral systems, the latter supplying manure for the farmers fields in exchange for water, cereals, etc. (manure contracting). Schematically, farming systems dynamics can be described as follows (cf. Kant, 2001)." }

{$>$}\emph{"Increasing population pressure forced arable farmers to increase cereal production to maintain food self-sufficiency for their families. Introduction of animal traction supported attainment of this goal by allowing cultivation of more land and maintaining labour productivity. Increasingly thus, arable farmers became livestock owners themselves, their livestock grazing the crop residues and the contracting communal village pastures, leaving pastoralists with less and less land for grazing. Consequently, pastoral systems were at that point doomed to extinction." }

{$>$}\emph{"With continued increase in population pressure, soil fertility management in farming N. de Ridder et al.= Agricultural Systems 80 (2004) 109-131 117" }

{$>$}\emph{"systems is characterised by intensified internal recycling of nutrients. Crop residues are increasingly collected and transported to the homesteads to feed animals that are kept in kraals and stables. This practice creates the opportunity to collect the manure that, mixed with animal feed refusals and household waste, is applied to arable fields close to the homesteads. Farmers owning less or no livestock, use the technique of composting crop residues and household waste, returning the upgraded organic material to the fields" }

{$>$}\emph{"Ultimately, a farming system evolves with zero grazing, where roughage is collected from wastelands and road sides to be used as mulch on the fields, for composting or as feed for the animals. This intensification of internal recycling of nutrients is associated with an increase in labour productivity, indicating that innovations are selected that increase production per hectare through increased input of labour (Kuyvenhoven and Ruben, 2002). However, with continued increase in labour availability as a result of increasing population, labour migration and offfarm income become more and more important." }

{$>$}\emph{"Further increases in labour input ultimately do not result in further increases in production per hectare and thus lead to reduced labour productivity. When a critical lower threshold in labour productivity is reached, farmers can switch to soil fertility management based on external inputs, i.e. inorganic fertilisers." }

{$>$}\emph{"Farmers may also seek for off-farm employment, but then earnings are not necessarily reinvested in soil fertility (c.f. De Jager et al., 1998). Not investing in external inputs to maintain and improve soil fertility will finally leave no other option for farmers than to quit farming." }

{$>$}\emph{"If farmers aims and aspirations are to continue farming with increased use of external inputs, labour productivity increases again. However, this change in farming systems will only occur, if markets for inputs and produce of food and cash crops are available and if the farm (economic, political, social and bio-physical) environment is conducive." }

  abstract = {Pearl millet production in the sandy soils of the Sahel is maintained by fallows and manures are the principal added source of fertility. Due to rapid population growth fallow periods are reduced, yields and nutrient availability decline and manure seems to be the only reasonable alternative for fallowing. This on-farm study (Banizoumbou, semi-arid Niger) investigates crop response to low and very low nutrient availability as well as within-season shortages and within field variations. Two sources of data were combined: a 3-year field experiment with dung application (5 Mg ha−1) and weeding frequency (no, two and four weedings); and a comparison of farming systems, n = 32, field × years (i) permanent cultivation with manure; (ii) cultivation after long fallows {$>$}15 years; (iii) cultivation after short fallows 3–5 years. The permanent cultivation of soils in the study area is achieved with extremely low levels of manure input 0.5–1 Mg ha−1 per year, adding about 10 kg N, 1.2 kg P and 5 kg K to the soil. Dung inputs allow grain yield (350 kg ha−1) and nutrient supply (ECEC 0.81 mmolc kg−1, total N 151 mg kg−1, 0–20 cm depth) to remain stable under prolonged cropping (10–17 years), while field without manure need fallowing for long periods ({$>$}15 years) to restore fertility. The trend from long to short fallow periods accords with decline in grain yield from 300 kg ha−1 yields down to 125 kg ha−1 and of a ECEC reduction from 1.10 to 0.72 mmolc kg−1. The positive effect of dung application on crop growth is restricted to the first half of the season resulting in extra panicles and 50\% extra crop residues. Other yield components remained unaffected and grain yield is but slightly improved because the initial good conditions do not continue. Very small variations in fertility—ECEC, NPK—induced by dung application, excessive weeding or due to soil surface conditions, had yet an impact on pearl millet growth and grain yield. The field experiment showed that nutrient levels and grain yield decline with excessive weeding but less so if dung is applied. Manuring is an alternative for fallowing rather than replacing it because additional constrains crop up with prolonged cultivation: the population of coprophage insects was reduced so some dung stayed unconsumed, and extremely sandy soils developed because wind erosion had carried off the most fertile particles from these rather bare soils making manure input no longer effective.},

  abstract = {Leafing, flowering and fruiting of the 24 most representative species of trees and shrubs in Sudanian savannas and fallows near Bondoukuy (Burkina Faso) were studied for 2 y (May 1992 toJune 1994). The period of defoliation was generally brief, and leaf flushing, flowering and fruiting occurred mostly in the d season. The phenological behaviour varied nonetheless across species and individuals. A classification taking into account synchrony/asynchrony and duration in foliation, flowering, fruit ripening and seed dispersal phases allowed comparison of species' phenological plasticity. Species were distributed along a scale of increasing plasticity, from trees to shrubs. Along this scale, species of the Leguminosae appeared to be separated from those of the Combretaceae, the latter being generally considered as characterising fallow farming systems. These results provide new evidence about the effect of phylogenetic constraints on the phenological behaviour of the woody species of the Sudanian savannas.},

  abstract = {Farmland abandonment is a widespread land-use change in temperate regions, due to increasing yields on productive lands, conservation policies, and the increasing imports of agricultural products from other regions. Assessing the environmental outcomes of abandonment and the potential for recultivation hinges on incomplete knowledge about the spatial patterns of fallow and abandoned farmland, especially at broad geographic scales. Our goals were to develop a methodology to map active and fallow land using MODIS Normalized Differenced Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series and to provide the first European-wide map of the extent of abandoned farmland (cropland and grassland) and recultivation. We used a geographically well-distributed training dataset to classify active and fallow farmland annually from 2001 to 2012 using a Random Forests classifier and validated the maps using independent observations from the field and from satellite images. The annual maps had an average overall accuracy of 90.1\% (average user's accuracy of the fallow class was 73.9\%), and we detected an average of 128.7 million hectares (Mha) of fallow land (24.4\% of all farmland). Using the fallow/active time series, we mapped fallow frequency and hotspots of farmland abandonment and recultivation of unused farmland. We found a total of 46.1 Mha of permanently fallow farmland, much of which may be linked to abandonment that occurred after the dissolution of the Eastern Bloc. Up to 7.6 Mha of farmland was additionally abandoned from 2001 to 2012, mainly in Eastern Europe, Southern Scandinavia, and Europe's mountain regions. Yet, recultivation is widespread too (up to 11.2 Mha) and occurred predominantly in Eastern Europe (e.g., European Russia, Poland, Belarus, Ukraine, and Lithuania) and in the Balkans. We also tested the robustness of our maps in relation to different abandonment and recultivation definitions, highlighting the usefulness of time series approaches to overcome problems when mapping transient land-use change. Our maps provide, to our knowledge, the first European-wide assessment of fallow, abandoned and recultivated farmland, thereby forming a basis for assessing the environmental outcomes of abandonment and recultivation and the potential of unused land for food production, bioenergy, and carbon storage.},

  abstract = {Farmers in the Sahel have been acknowledged for reclaiming degraded lands and improving food security by ingeniously modifying traditional agroforestry, water, and soil management practices. Despite the advantages offered by this range of farming techniques, their adoption rate is influenced by several factors. Using multivariate probit models and a correlation coefficient, this article examines the factors influencing the adoption of five land management practices based on 220 household and 40 farm surveys in four adjacent rural communities in southern Burkina Faso. The model results indicate that household labor force, education of household head, land tenure security, livestock holding, and membership in farmers’ groups influence the adoption of zaï practice, composting, improved fallow, stone bunds, and live hedges. However, two of the surveyed factors number of farms and visit by agricultural extension staff during the 12 months prior to the survey - were not significant. Furthermore, a significant correlation was found between different land management practices, e.g., the decision to practice zaï is significantly linked to that of live hedges and composting. Zaï practice and stone bunds are considered labor intensive, which explains their significant correlations with household labor force at the 1\% and 5\% levels of significance, respectively.},

  abstract = {Soil degradation is a major constraint to food security in many parts of sub-Saharan Africa. We examined the effect of indigen­ ous (the traditional use of rotating fallow-based systems (toss) for livestock herding and soil enrichment) and non-indigenous farming patterns (the use of fertilizer input or no-inputs (nontoss)) on millet yields and soil characteristics in six villages in west-central Senegal. Soil samples were collected in 60 fields in six villages at 0–10 cm depth in 5 random locations in each field. Total yield was measured as head weight per m2 and head weight per plant. The use of toss systems and hybrid farming (toss + fertilizer input) provided higher millet yields than con­ ventional and low-input systems, and the effects of chemical fertilizer were modest in the small amounts applied by the farmers (7 kg/ha of 15–10-10 N-P-K). Soil carbon and pH and the number of trees were the best predictors of millet yield, but the overall predictive power was modest (R2 {$<$} 0.34). This research sheds new light on the evolving role of local techni­ ques and knowledge in the struggle to maintain agricultural productivity, as Sahelian communities confront soil fertility depletion and food insecurity.},

  abstract = {Soils used for rainfed cereal production in Niger are sandy, deficient in major nutrients (N and P), and also low in organic matter content. Scarce rainfall with an unpredictable distribution in space and time makes crop and nutrient management difficult. Observations were made in 1996 and 1997 on management by a Fulani tribal household, based on manure application through corralling and on use of fallow. Field corralling of cattle left between 1.5 and 17 Mg ha−1 of manure on limited areas of the fields. Millet grain yields were increased from 500 kg ha−1 in areas manured 6 or more years ago to 1100 kg ha−1 in recently manured areas. Drought during the growing season of 1997 limited the effects of manure application on grain and straw yields. Soil carbon and nitrogen levels were higher at depths below 0.20 m in sites where manure was applied 4–5 years ago (M4), while pH and P were higher in 0–0.10 m of the soil profile in practices where manure was applied the same year (M0). Nutrient management in 1997 could have been improved by reducing the locally very high manure rates in order to fertilize a two or three times larger area and consequently improve yields over a larger area and reduce risks of nutrient leaching and crop damage from droughts. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

  abstract = {Models are increasingly being used to investigate agro-ecosystems dynamics, although processes interacting at different scales remain difficult to consider. When upscaled or downscaled based on aggregation or disaggregation methods, information is generally distorted. This study explores agro-ecosystem modelling using an interaction graph-based modelling approach that explicitly link elements at different scales without up or downscaling. The study area/time frame is the cotton region of West Burkina Faso over the last fifteen years. Field, plot, farm and climate entities are linked in graphs that evolve according to functions computed along different time steps. Three main processes and their interrelations are simulated, occurring at different spatial and temporal scales: crop area expansion, crop rotation and crop production. Three simulation examples are presented to illustrate the analytical possibilities allowed by the approach. These examples test i) the geographical distribution of plots as a means to face climatic risks, ii) the effect of fallowing practice in a spatially constrained cotton dominated landscape and iii) the consequences of reduced access to credit for farmers to buy fertilizers. Model outputs enable quantifying and mapping the respective effects of processes at different scales. Results show that modelling across scales is achievable without resorting to methods of aggregation or disaggregation, which opens new perspectives in multi-scalar analyses of agro-ecosystems that link land production and land use and land cover.},

The soil-improving potential of two tree species [Gliricidia sepium (gliricidia) and Pteocarpus erinaceus (pterocarpus)] and a shrubby legume Stylosanthes hamata (stylosanthes) was investigated in a four-year study on farmer’s field and in a research station in the Koutiala region in southern Mali (12.25° N, 5.42° W; 650 to 850 mm annual, unimodal rainfall; on a Typic Plinthustalf). Two strategies for soil improvement were tested: improved fallow sensu stricto and biomass transfer, the former ‘on-farm’ and the latter ‘on-station.’ In the on-farm experiment, maize (Zea mays) yielded best when it followed a twoyear fallow of gliricidia alone or in association with stylosanthes. On the research station, maize dry matter production and grain yields during two seasons following the application of ex-situ grown biomass were similar and highest in the stylosanthes- and manure-applied treatments. The biomass decomposition rates of the three species were in the order: gliricidia {$>$} stylosanthes {$>$} pterocarpus. The treatments did not have any significant effects on the soil fertility parameters that were monitored, possibly because of the short-term nature of the study. The treatments effects on crop yields were, however, significant. Gliricidia + stylosanthes in combination appeared to be particularly promising as short-rotation-fallow species in the region.},

Land use shifts have also to be taken into account when analyzing changes in vegetation production. To study how land use changes may impact vegetation response along a climatic gradient, we used three MODIS NDVI metrics time series (2000-2012) and a land cover map from MODIS Land Cover product. We performed a trend analysis and analyzed temporal profiles of the three metrics according to three climatic zones (Sahelian, Sudanian and Guinean zones). Our results indicate differences in NDVI values of Croplands and Natural Vegetation and that these differences are in connection with climatic zones. In the Sahelian zone Croplands tend to have higher values than Natural vegetation, whereas the opposite is observed for the Sudanian and Guinean zones.},

  abstract = {The increasing frequency and severity of extreme climatic events and their impacts are being realized in many regions of the world, particularly in smallholder crop and livestock production systems in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). These events underscore the need for timely early warning. Satellite Earth Observation (EO) availability, rapid developments in methodology to archive and process them through cloud services and advanced computational capabilities, continue to generate new opportunities for providing accurate, reliable, and timely information for decision-makers across multiple cropping systems and for resource-constrained institutions. Today, systems and tools that leverage these developments to provide open access actionable early warning information exist. Some have already been employed by early adopters and are currently operational in selecting national monitoring programs in Angola, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda. Despite these capabilities, many governments in SSA still rely on traditional crop monitoring systems, which mainly rely on sparse and long latency in situ reports with little to no integration of EO-derived crop conditions and yield models. This study reviews open-access operational agricultural monitoring systems available for Africa. These systems provide the best-available open-access EO data that countries can readily take advantage of, adapt, adopt, and leverage to augment national systems and make significant leaps (timeliness, spatial coverage and accuracy) of their monitoring programs. Data accessible (vegetation indices, crop masks) in these systems are described showing typical outputs. Examples are provided including crop conditions maps, and damage assessments and how these have integrated into reporting and decision-making. The discussion compares and contrasts the types of data, assessments and products can expect from using these systems. This paper is intended for individuals and organizations seeking to access and use EO to assess crop conditions who might not have the technical skill or computing facilities to process raw data into informational products.},

  abstract = {An experiment was conducted in three rainfall zones of Niger, West Africa, to evaluate the potential of mulched and nonmulched bare fallow to conserve water in deep, sandy soils. Water content of adjacent bare and cropped experimental plots was monitored with a neutron probe at three sites during the 1985 growing season and the subsequent dry season. Experimental sites, with soil type and 1985 rainfall, were nearthe villagesof Chikal (UsticTorripsamment; 233 mm) N'Dounga (Psammentic Paleustalf; 344 mm), and Kala Pate (Alfic Ustipsamment; 428 mm). Cropped plots were managed using traditional low-input practices. Bare plots were weeded using a traditional, shallow cultivating hoe. At the end of the growing season, portions of the bare and cropped plots were mulched with millet stalks at a rate of 25 Mg ha'1. At the end of the dry season, no significant increases in profile water storage were detected in mulched treatments. Increased soil water storage in the upper 1.65 m of bare fallowed plots toward the end of the dry season was 16.5 ± 10.5 mm at Chikal, and 40.6 ± 17.9 mm at N'Dounga. No increase in storage was observed in bare fallowed plots at Kala Pate. Mean increases in storage efficiency at Chikal and N'Dounga were 7.1\% and 11.8\%, respectively. Position of the zero-flux boundary during the dry season and profile water distributiontoward the end of the dry season indicate that drainage was substantial at all sites. However, large losses due to evaporation are also possible, due to high evaporative demand during the dry season. Data obtained in this study suggest that bare fallowing, with and without dry-season mulching, is an inefficient means of water conservation for these soil systems. A possible application of bare fallow is in sandy soils underlaid by laterite in high-risk, low-rainfall zones of the Sahel if accompanied by adequate erosion prevention.},

The paper documents the improvements in agricultural practices and land-use management in subSaharan Africa that could increase agricultural productivity and sequester soil carbon. During the first five-year commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol, only afforestation and reforestation projects will be eligible for crediting under the Clean Development Mechanism, but soil carbon sequestration and broader sink activities could become eligible during subsequent commitment periods. However, very few cost estimates of soil carbon sequestration strategies exist, and available data are not readily comparable. It is uncertain how large amounts of carbon could be sequestered, and it is unclear how well site-specific studies represent wider areas. It is concluded that there presently is a need to launch long-term ({$>$}10 years) field experiments and demonstration and pilot projects for soil carbon sequestration in Africa. It will be important to monitor all environmental effects and carbon ‘costs’ as well as estimate all economic benefits and costs of projects.},

  abstract = {The article provides a quantitative analysis of temporal variation in fallow characteristics, and spatial variation in fallow distribution, pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum) yield and soil fertility in three villages in the Bankass area in Sahelian Mali. Plots of 5 m Â 5 m along four transects were installed at 10, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000 and 2000 m from the edge of the village compounds to the outer boundary of the village territory. We found that currently, fallow is practiced only in ‘bushfields’, which are further than 200 m away from the dwellings. Significant increases in the amount of organic C and soil nutrients (N, P and K) were found with increasing fallow duration. This was due to gradual accumulation of organic matter from fallow vegetation and the presence of leguminous species. Soil nutrients and organic C were higher in homefields ({$<$}200 m away from farmer dwellings) than in bushfields. Also, millet grain yields were highly correlated with soil nutrients, and decreased from 1060 kg haÀ1 in homefields to 520 kg haÀ1 in bushfields. Yields in bushfields ranged from 450 kg haÀ1 on fields cultivated for several years to 640 kg haÀ1 after 4–7 years of fallow. Regression analysis showed that millet yields were negatively correlated with infestation by the parasitic weed Striga hermonthica. Future research needs to focus on the relationship between Striga infestation and soil factors.},

Landsat-8 surface reflectance (Bands 2–7) and vegetation indices (NDVI, EVI, SAVI, and MSAVI), organized to include dry-season and growing-season band reflectances and vegetation indices for the years 2013–2015, were used as predictors. Training data were derived from an independent, high-resolution, visually interpreted sample dataset that classifies sample points across West Africa using a 2-km grid (\textasciitilde 380,000 points were used in this study, with 50\% used for model training and 50\% used for model validation). Analysis of the new cropland dataset indicates a summed cropland area of \textasciitilde 316 × 103 km2 across the 5 countries, primarily in rainfed cropland (309 × 103 km2), with irrigated cropland area (7 × 103 km2) representing 2\% of the total cropland area. At regional scale, the cropland dataset has an overall accuracy of 90.1\% and a cropland class (rainfed and irrigated) user’s accuracy of 79\%. At bioclimatic zones scale, results show that land proportion occupied by rainfed agriculture increases with annual precipitation up to 1000 mm. The Sudanian zone (600–1200 mm) has the highest proportion of land in agriculture (24\%), followed by the Sahelian (200–600 mm) and the Guinean (1200 +) zones for 15\% and 4\%, respectively.

  abstract = {Soil seed banks (SSBs) play a key role in the post-disturbance recruitment of many plant species. Seed bank diversity can be influenced by spatial and environmental variability and disturbance heterogeneity across the landscape. Understanding the recovery potential of native vegetation from SSBs is important for restoration and biodiversity conservation. Yet, in savanna-woodland, little is known about how SSBs vary in their germination, composition and density under different land uses, and how SSBs relate to aboveground vegetation (AGV). Using a sampling design based on the Land Degradation Surveillance Framework, we assessed the SSB and AGV in twelve 0.25 ha plots among sixteen in four contrasting land use systems of savanna-woodland in Burkina Faso: bushland, cultivated farmland, fallow and wetland. A total of 720 soil samples were taken from four stratified depths of 0–5 cm, {$>$} 5–10 cm, {$>$} 10–15 cm, and {$>$} 15–20 cm. The SSB composition and richness was determined by the seedling emergence technique. Results showed that the SSB in all land uses was largely dominated by annual grasses with few perennial herbaceous and woody species. Seed density was highest in the fallow soil and highest in the upper soil layers for all land uses. A non-metric multidimensional scaling ordination of the SSB and AGV indicated that the SSBs were a poor reflection of the AGV. Based on these findings, spatial variations in landscape characteristics not only influence seed distribution and viability but also have the potential to influence population persistence. These results imply that successful restoration of fragmented ecosystems requires the addition of seeds and seedlings of target species.},

Pratiquée jusqu'au xvrn'v siècle en Europe occidentale, elle représentait les 15 mois sans peuplement cultivé durant lesquels des labours réitérés de printemps et d'été préparaient ett nettoyaient les terres lourdes pour les semis de blés d'hiver (Sigaut, 1993). Outre l'acheb (jachère pâturée) nord-africain (Jouve, 1993), on trouve des systèmes de jachère biennale autour de villages Sereer au Sénégal (Pélissier, 1966). Jachères longues, cultures courtes Dans la culture nomade ou itinérante, le hameau se déplace sporadiquement avec les cultures qui l'entourent (de Schlippé, 1986). La culture à longue jachère dans laquelle une brève phase de culture suit une longue période de jachère concerne la périphérie des terroirs villageois d'Afrique. Notons ici qu'un essartage, proche de la culture itinérante tropicale, existait en Europe, le revenu principal étant issu du bois de tailliss (Laudelout, 1990). L'essartage est aussi pratiqué en Europe sur certaines landes acides, de nos jours.. Jachères sans durées définies Il existe des jachères (ou friches) sans rôles culturaux, mais dont les rôles s'observent au niveau du systèmee de production. En Afrique de l'Ouest, les contradictions entre objectifs d'assolement, exigences dee successions de culture et variations inter-annuelles de disponibilités en travail et intrants, exigent dess espaces d'inertie et produisent donc des jachères courtes (Lericollais et Milleville, 1993).

  abstract = {The impact of human activities via land use/cover changes on NDVI trends is critical for an improved understanding of satellite-observed changes in vegetation productivity in drylands. The dominance of positive NDVI trends in the Sahel, the so-called re-greening, is sometimes interpreted as a combined effect of an increase in rainfall and cropland expansion or agricultural intensification. Yet, the impact of changes in land use has yet to be thoroughly tested and supported by empirical evidence. At present, no studies have considered the importance of the different seasonal NDVI signals of cropped and fallowed fields when interpreting NDVI trends, as both field types are commonly merged into a single ‘cropland’ class. We make use of the distinctly different phenology of cropped and fallowed fields and use seasonal NDVI curves to separate these two field types. A fuzzy classifier is applied to quantify cropped and fallowed areas in a case study region in the southern Sahel (Fakara, Niger) on a yearly basis between 2000 and 2014. We find that fallowed fields have a consistently higher NDVI than unmanured cropped fields and by using two seasonal NDVI metrics (the amplitude and the decreasing rate) derived from the MODIS time series, a clear separation between classes of fields is achieved (r = 0.77). The fuzzy classifier can compute the percentage of a pixel (250 m) under active cultivation, thereby alleviating the problem of small field sizes in the region. We find a predominant decrease in NDVI over the period of analysis associated with an increased area of cropped fields at the expense of fallowed fields. Our findings couple cropping abandonment (more frequent fallow years) with positive NDVI trends and an increase in the percentage of the cropped area (fallow period shortening) with negative trends. These findings profoundly impact our understanding of greening and browning trends in agrarian Sahelian drylands and in other drylands of developing countries characterized by limited use of fertilizers.},

  abstract = {Remote sensing-derived cropland products have depicted the location and extent of agricultural lands with an ever increasing accuracy. However, limited attention has been devoted to distinguishing between actively cropped fields and fallowed fields within agricultural lands, and in particular so in grass fallow systems of semiarid areas. In the Sahel, one of the largest dryland regions worldwide, crop-fallow rotation practices are widely used for soil fertility regeneration. Yet, little is known about the extent of fallow fields since fallow is not explicitly differentiated within the cropland class in any existing remote sensing-based land use/cover maps, regardless of the spatial scale. With a 10 m spatial resolution and a 5-day revisit frequency, Sentinel-2 satellite imagery made it possible to disentangle agricultural land into cropped and fallow fields, facilitated by Google Earth Engine (GEE) for big data handling. Here we produce the first Sahelian fallow field map at a 10 m resolution for the baseline year 2017, accomplished by designing a remote sensing driven protocol for generating reference data for mapping over large areas. Based on the 2015 Copernicus Dynamic Land Cover map at 100 m resolution, the extent of fallow fields in the cropland class is estimated to be 63\% (403,617 km2) for the Sahel in 2017. Similar results are obtained for five contemporary cropland products, with fallow fields occupying 57–62\% of the cropland area. Yet, it is noted that the total estimated area coverage depends on the quality of the different cropland products. The share of cropped fields within the Copernicus cropland area is found to be higher in the arid regions (200–300 mm rainfall) as compared to the semi-arid regions (300–600 mm rainfall). The woody cover fraction within cropped and fallow fields is found to have a reversed pattern between arid (higher woody cover in cropped fields) and semi-arid (higher woody cover in fallow fields) regions. The method developed, using cloud-based Earth Observation (EO) data and computation on the GEE platform, is expected to be reproducible for mapping the extent of fallow fields across global croplands. Future applications based on multi-year time series is expected to improve our understanding of crop-fallow rotation dynamics in grass fallow systems being key in teasing apart how cropland intensification and expansion affect environmental variables, such as soil fertility, crop yields and local livelihoods in low-income regions such as the Sahel. The mapping result can be visualized via a web viewer (https://buwuyou.users.earthengine.app/view/fallowinsahel).},

---

{$>$}\emph{"We derived seasonal metrics from MODIS NDVI for the year 2017 to define the period representing the maximum spectral difference between cropped and fallowfields, which is located around drydown period of the growing season. This period was used to define the start and end time of the relevant Sentinel-2 imagery acquisition period. The seasonal metrics were extracted from the MODIS 8-day NDVI composites using the TIMESAT software (Jönsson and Eklundh, 2004Table 1)" }

---

{$>$}\emph{"In TIMESAT, we set the window size to 4, the seasonal parameter to 0.5 tofit one season per year, the number of iterations for upper envelope adaptation to 2, and the strength of the envelope adaptation to 2" }

---

{$>$}\emph{"The time of the mid of season (MOS) was computed as the average time between the green-up phase (80\% of the amplitude before the maximum), and the dry-down phase (80\% after maximum) (Eklundh and Jönsson, 2017). The end of season (EOS) was set to 50\% after the maximum (Zhang et al., 2018)." }

---

{$>$}\emph{"The study area was segmented into 0.15° × 0.15° grids in which the MOS and EOS dates were averaged from the MODIS pixels within each grid. The size of the grid cells was selected by trial and error and is a compromise being big enough to include both crop/fallow classes, but do not exceed the size beyond which local landscape characteristics disappear. The Sentinel-2 image acquisition was then guided by the MOS and EOS dates determined for each grid cell individually" }

---

{$>$}\emph{"For each grid, Sentinel-2 images with a cloud cover larger than 10\% were excluded and to further reduce the impacts from clouds and burned areas, compositing of the remaining Sentinel-2 image series (VNIR and NDVI between MOS and EOS) was produced by taking the median value for the subsequent analysis." }

-She created grids of 0.15° resolution (i think of it as shape figures), for each cell he determined MOS and EOS.

-Then went to sentinel-2 images and extract images to those specific dates and locations. Here he dismiss images with more than 10\% clouds and then he did something weird. }
\par
---

\par
\emph{So, she used an unsupervised classifier (WEKA) to discriminate a random selection of sentinel-2 pixels into fallow or cropped field.

*****BUT, she only used top and lowest NDVI pixels**** (NOT GOOD IDEA) }
\par
---

{$>$}\emph{"We randomly selected one million pixels (a resolution of 10 m × 10 m) within the study area. Out of these one million pixels, we automatically classified the pixels within each 0.15° × 0.15° grid as follows: A) each pixel was classified into two classes as either cropped or fallow based on Sentinel-2 visible bands, NIR band and NDVI using WEKA (Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis) unsupervised classification (Smith and Frank, 2016). B) Given that an unsupervised classification normally produces outputs with a rather low accuracy in cases of spectral similarities, we only used the pixels with the lowest (in respect to NDVI values) 25\% of the croppedfields class and the highest 25\% of the fallowfields class as the reference dataset in thefirst stage" }

---

{$>$}\emph{"smallfield patches (usually evenly scattered across the landscape) were targeted for selecting an enhanced reference dataset in this second stage" }

---

\par
\emph{Here, she selected some "small field patches" from it's first artificial reference dataset. Did she manually determine the class?? and then used it for running he's random forest classification?? }
\par
---

{$>$}\emph{"This was achieved by using the first stage reference dataset from the WEKA unsupervised classification as input for a Random Forest (RF) classifier, which was applied for each 0.15° grid" }

---

{$>$}\emph{"For each grid cell, the values of Sentinel-2 spectral bands and NDVI of the reference pixels were used as predictor variables to predict the crop and fallow classe" }

---

{$>$}\emph{"We then extracted small cropped and fallow field patches over the entire study area from the RF classification results by applying a spatial morphological analysis, for which only connected areas within a range of 10-20 Sentinel-2 pixels targeting individualfields of 1 ha" }

---

{$>$}\emph{"For validation of the enhanced reference data, we generated 200 pixels (100 within cropped and 100 within fallow fields) within the CGLS-LC100 cropland extent of the Sahel and visually evaluated the accuracy based on the Sentinel-2 false-color image composites" }

---

{$>$}\emph{"For each Sentinel- 2 tile, each decision tree grows on an independent bootstrap sample from the training data. A total number of 2000 stratified random sample pixels were generated within the extent of small-sizefield patches of each tile (1000 within cropped and 1000 within fallowfields)." }

---

{$>$}\emph{"A surprisingfinding of this study is the high percentage of fallow in the croplands of the Sahel. This suggests that regeneration of soil fertility through fallowing plays a greater rolerelative to replenishment of plant nutrients by recycling livestock manure or importing mineral fertilizersthan previously expected (Schlecht et al., 2004)." }

---

\par
\emph{Tong stated as a surprising fact that, according to her findings, fallow fields represented a much higher proportion than expected in sahelian region. However, our analysis in a study case on Soudanian area suggests that this methodological approach highly overstimated the proportion of fallow fields. }
\par
---

{$>$}\emph{"Indeed, a multi-year assessment of grass fallowing is expected to harness the fallowfield mapping in this aspect, since separation of fallow from grazing areas independently from using a cropland mask, would only be feasible from analyzing states of multiple years." }

---

\par
\emph{Tong hilighted the likelihood of missclassified grass-land field as fallow fields. Still these, in both cases these fields would be used for feeding livestock. Tong stated that differentiation of grasslands from fallow fields would be only possible throough a multi-year approach. }
\par
---

{$>$}\emph{"The results show that a considerable extent of what is often mapped as cropland did actually not produce crop yields in 2017, which needs to be considered when food production is estimated based on cropland products." }

---

\par
\emph{Despite a possible issue of natural spaces missclassified as fallow fields, Tong's findings suggest that there is a high proportion of non-active agricultural land missclassified as active-cropland in land products for 2017. This is of high relevance since these land cover products are widely use for estimations of food production. }
\par
---

{$>$}\emph{"The fact that fallowfields dominate over croppedfields contradicts common narratives that population pressure and increased demand for food have caused a Sahel-wide extinction of fallow practices leading to unsustainable land management systems (Pieri, 1989; Lüdeke et al., 2004)." }

---

\par
\emph{Currently there are two main narratives with regards to fallow field trends: The most common narrative is that fallow field are going extinct as a result of the increased food demand and increasing populations, which requires a higher amount of, increasingly intensive, cropland at the expense of fallow land. Whereas a less popular narrative claims that fallow land represents a higher proportion of what actually perceived, sustained by land abandonment due to population migrating to cities or civil conflicts. }
\par
---

{$>$}\emph{"Once afield is changed from fallow to cropland, shrubs and bushes are typically coppiced and only trees having reached a certain height are kept. It should be noted that the result is potentially sensitive to the abovementioned challenges of misclassification of rangelands as fallow (a problem inherited in the cropland masks used)." }

---

\par
\emph{Tong also stated that shrubs as trees might have an homogenic effect over NDVI signal among classes. }
\par
---

{$>$}\emph{"In this study, Sentinel-2 has proved to be useful in separating individualfields. Since 2013, Landsat 8 has collected 30 m images with a global coverage every 16 days. The integration of Landsat and Sentinel- 2 (Claverie et al., 2018; Yan et al., 2016) would significantly increase the temporal resolution of annual time series, but with known effects of spatial misalignment between images (Carrasco et al., 2019). However, the increased temporal resolution of a merged dataset has already been used to separate crop types (Griffiths et al., 2019), which could be the next step in better characterizing Sahelian land use practices." }

---

\par
\emph{Tong suggested that a multi-source approach might be usefull for enhancing temporal resolution. An example of this for separating crop types has been performed by Griffiths (check reference \#read\_paper). Although these approaches have issues of misalignment (Carrasco et al., 2019 \#read\_paper) }
\par
---

{$>$}\emph{"Based upon time series of high resolution satellite data agricultural land can instead be mapped into different classes characterizing management practices of croppedfields: permanent, shifting with short, medium, long duration fallow." }

  abstract = {The automation of agricultural mapping using satellite-derived remotely sensed data remains a challenge in Africa because of the heterogeneous and fragmental landscape, complex crop cycles, and limited access to local knowledge. Currently, consistent, continent-wide routine cropland mapping of Africa does not exist, with most studies focused either on certain portions of the continent or at most a one-time effort at mapping the continent at coarse resolution remote sensing. In this research, we addressed these limitations by applying an automated cropland mapping algorithm (ACMA) that captures extensive knowledge on the croplands of Africa available through: (a) ground-based training samples, (b) very high (submeter to five-meter) resolution imagery (VHRI), and (c) local knowledge captured during field visits and/ or sourced from country reports and literature. The study used 16-day time-series of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) composited data at 250-m resolution for the entire African continent. Based on these data, the study first produced accurate reference cropland layers or RCLs (cropland extent/areas, irrigation versus rainfed, cropping intensities, crop dominance, and croplands versus cropland fallows) for the year 2014 that provided an overall accuracy of around 90\% for crop extent in different agro-ecological zones (AEZs). The RCLs for the year 2014 (RCL2014) were then used in the development of the ACMA algorithm to create ACMA-derived cropland layers for 2014 (ACL2014). ACL2014 when compared pixel-by-pixel with the RCL2014 had an overall similarity greater than 95\%. Based on the ACL2014, the African continent had 296 Mha of net cropland areas (260 Mha cultivated plus 36 Mha fallows) and 330 Mha of gross cropland areas. Of the 260 Mha of net cropland areas cultivated during 2014, 90.6\% (236 Mha) was rainfed and just 9.4\% (24 Mha) was irrigated. Africa has about 15\% of the world’s population, but only about 6\% of world’s irrigation. Net cropland area distribution was 95 Mha during season 1, 117 Mha during season 2, and 84 Mha continuous. About 58\% of the rainfed and 39\% of the irrigated were single crops (net cropland area without cropland fallows) cropped during either season 1 (January-May) or season 2 (JuneSeptember). The ACMA algorithm was deployed on Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing platform and applied on MODIS time-series data from 2003 through 2014 to obtain ACMA-derived cropland layers for these years (ACL2003 to ACL2014). The results indicated that over these twelve years, on average: (a) croplands increased by 1 Mha/yr, and (b) cropland fallows decreased by 1 Mha/year. Cropland areas computed from ACL2014 for the 55 African countries were largely underestimated when compared with an independent source of census-based cropland data, with a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 3.5 Mha. ACMA demonstrated the ability to hind-cast (past years), now-cast (present year), and forecast (future years) cropland products using MODIS 250-m time-series data rapidly, but currently, insufficient reference data exist to rigorously report trends from these results.},

However, to use these products as accurate and reliable cropland estimation for the practical purpose is questionable. For example, Cropland estimates derived from GlobCover are 20\% higher than those derived from MODIS globally (Fritz et al., 2011a,b). Further, the spatial location of the croplands between any two of these global LULC products varies substantially. These factors have led to differences in cropland areas between various products which is as much as staggering 300 Mha globally (varying from 1.5 to 1.8 billion hectares). For example, the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) of the United Nations (UN) estimates that, around the year 2010, there was 319 Mha of croplands in Africa compared to the significantly lower MODIS land cover and GlobCover estimates of 277 Mha and 152 Mha, respectively. There are many reasons for such differences such as 1. these products are more focused on LULC systems than on agricultural systems, 2. definition issues, 3. resolution of the data used, 4. other data characteristics (e.g., spectral, radiometric), and 5. Methods adopted. Further, in these products croplands are not a single land cover class, but are contained within the mosaic of classes without specific agricultural information such as irrigation, cropping intensity, or crop type. All of these factors lead to substantial uncertainties in cropland assessment and related products of cropland water use and food security assessment and reporting." }

  abstract = {Agricultural land abandonment is a common land-use change, making the accurate mapping of both location and timing when agricultural land abandonment occurred important to understand its environmental and social outcomes. However, it is challenging to distinguish agricultural abandonment from transitional classes such as fallow land at high spatial resolutions due to the complexity of change process. To date, no robust approach exists to detect when agricultural land abandonment occurred based on 30-m Landsat images. Our goal here was to develop a new approach to detect the extent and the exact timing of agricultural land abandonment using spatial and temporal segments derived from Landsat time series. We tested our approach for one Landsat footprint in the Caucasus, covering parts of Russia and Georgia, where agricultural land abandonment is widespread. First, we generated agricultural land image objects from multi-date Landsat imagery using a multiresolution segmentation approach. Second, we estimated the probability for each object that agricultural land was used each year based on Landsat temporal-spectral metrics and a random forest model. Third, we applied temporal segmentation of the resulting agricultural land probability time series to identify change classes and detect when abandonment occurred. We found that our approach was able to accurately separate agricultural abandonment from active agricultural lands, fallow land, and re-cultivation. Our spatial and temporal segmentation approach captured the changes at the object level well (overall mapping accuracy = 97 ± 1\%), and performed substantially better than pixel-level change detection (overall accuracy = 82 ± 3\%). We found strong spatial and temporal variations in agricultural land abandonment rates in our study area, likely a consequence of regional wars after the collapse of the Soviet Union. In summary, the combination of spatial and temporal segmentation approaches of time-series is a robust method to track agricultural land abandonment and may be relevant for other land-use changes as well.},

{$>$}\emph{"We used a bottom-up multi-resolution segmentation algorithm in eCognition™ (Baatz and Schäpe, 2000). This approach initiates each pixel as a single segment and merges spatially adjacent segments based on their similarity until the desired scale is met. Scale is a'window of perception' and determined by the spatial resolution of the satellite imagery and the size of the objects of interest (Marceau, 1999). Specifically, the scale parameter defines the maximum standard deviation of heterogeneity used for image segmentation (Benz et al., 2004). A higher scale value allows more tolerance of heterogeneity within one object and results in larger image objects (Fig. S2). The merging decision is based on local homogeneity criteria which describes the" }

{$>$}\emph{"similarity (e.g. Euclidean distance) of adjacent objects. Two homogeneity criteria, spectral and shape homogeneity are used in eCognition™. The spectral criterion is more important for generating better segmentation (Yu et al., 2016). However, a certain degree of shape homogeneity often improves the quality of object extraction because it ensures the compactness of spatial objects (eCognition, 2011). We assigned equal weight to each band and used weights for color and shape of 0.8 and 0.2, respectively (Pu et al., 2011; Yu et al., 2016). Applying single-scale parameter to different types of land-cover that vary in size often consolidates small neighboring objects into larger ones (under-segmentation), or partitions single large objects into smaller sub-objects (over-segmentation) (Evans et al., 2002). The conventional evaluation approach requires to check for either visually, and test different parameters iteratively, which is time-consuming and subjective (Vieira et al., 2012). Spatial variance and autocorrelation provide alternative means to assess segmentation quality because optimal segmentation should minimize intra-segment variance while maximizing inter-segment difference (Espindola et al., 2006; Johnson and Xie, 2011)." }

{$>$}\emph{"For each random forest models during 1985 and 2015, we increased the number of the tress from 1 to 1000 at a step of 1. The F1 score was calculated as F1 = 2 × UA × PA / (UA + PA), where UA and PA stand for user's and producer's accuracy derived from the out-of-bag (OOB) error in random forest model, respectively. The result showed that the F1 score was higher than 90\% using a tree number of 1000 for every year from1985 to 2015 (Fig. S5). We, therefore, used a tree number of 1000 to train the random forest model for each year." }

{$>$}\emph{"3.3.2. Temporal segmentation and agricultural land abandonment labeling" }

{$>$}\emph{"We used a temporal segmentation approach LandTrendr to detect changes in each object class probability over time (Fig. 3)." }

{$>$}\emph{"LandTrendr decomposes annual Landsat time series into different segments to capture both long-term gradual and short-term drastic changes. The core curvefitting function used in LandTrendr is MPFIT, which is an implementation of the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm (Markwardt, 2009)." }

{$>$}\emph{"We used several metrics to describe temporal segments in the time series of agriculture land probability, including the start and end time and segment duration (in years). Because of the Landsat data gap in the early 1990s, we ran LandTrendr on agriculture land probability from 1998 to 2015." }

{$>$}\emph{"Based on thefitted agriculture land probability time series, we distinguished agricultural land abandonment, re-cultivation, and fallow from stable agricultural land" }

{$>$}\emph{"possible sampling bias (Card, 1982)." }

{$>$}\emph{"If the agricultural land was not active from 1998 to 2003, we considered the corresponding object as agricultural land abandonment before or in 1998 (hereafter 1998). Second, we labeled agricultural land abandonment objects that were converted to active agricultural land and remained active for more than four years as re-cultivation. Third, agricultural land that stayed inactive for less thanfive years was mapped as fallow land. Last, agriculture objects which were never labeled as abandoned, re-cultivation, or fallow were mapped as stable agricultural land." }

{$>$}\emph{"To avoid problems with small sample sizes for rare thematic classes such as agricultural land abandonment, we used disproportionate stratified sampling at the pixel level for validation (Olofsson et al., 2014; Stehman et al., 2003)." }

{$>$}\emph{"To avoid including different land-use trajectories into the same object, we used a scale of 50 to obtain actualfield size and create homogenous agricultural land objects." }},
